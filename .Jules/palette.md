## 2024-05-24 - WebXR DOM Overlay and ARIA Live Regions
**Learning:** Adding standard HTML UI over a Three.js WebXR canvas requires explicitly configuring the `ARButton` to request the `dom-overlay` optional feature and passing a DOM element as the root. A regular HTML structure can act as a notification center (like a Toast) in AR. Moreover, injecting accessibility tags like `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to the overlay toast container ensures that standard accessible text notification features are fully available to XR users.
**Action:** When creating any 2D HUD or feedback overlay over a WebXR experience, always use the `dom-overlay` feature mapped to a container element and attach `aria-live` to dynamically updating message containers within that root overlay.
